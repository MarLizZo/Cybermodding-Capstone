## ðŸ“œ How to

<p>In order to succesfully run this project on your machine there are few things to setup.</p>

`If you only use VS Code:`

`If you use Eclipse and VS Code:`

-   Only Angular Language Server on VS Code

<p></p>

When everything is ready, run the Back-end project with either Eclipse or VS Code and wait until you see `** Ops Done **` on the console.

<p></p>

Then, open the Front-end project with VS Code and open an istance of the integrated terminal (Terminal - New Terminal).

Run the command `npm i` This will install all the dependencies needed to run the project.

Run the command `ng s -o` This will compile and open a new browser window with the localhost server up and running.
